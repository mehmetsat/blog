Even in my childhood, I was always known as the tech person that solves computer related problems in my village. I was fascinated by the improvements of the computer and mobile phone industry, and keeping track of every new development in these industries over the years. This leads to choosing Electrical and Electronics Engineering as the field of study of my major.
 
As the source of my self confidence, I dreamt about being accepted to the best university  in that field in Turkey which is Bogazici University and achieved this first big success in my educational path. To be accepted, the candidate must be placed in the first 500 students among the 2 million participants and I have placed 59th in this exam.

In my first 2 years of Bachelorâ€™s, I have gained a very strong background of mathematics and engineering thanks to our excellent professors. In the following years, courses are specialized for electrical engineering. At this point, I have started to realize that electrical engineering is a little out of my interest. The course that we took about programming foundations with C fascinated me. This was the breakpoint of thinking to shift to computer science as my career. Besides my study, I started to take some online courses about Machine Learning. This enthusiasm for computer science leads to searching for an internship in that field.

Instead of shifting my major to Computer Science, I search for an internship to gain practical experience and to be sure about my decision. I landed an internship at a very popular start-up in our country, Getir. The internship was about Data Science that is related to Machine Learning. I was working for a new branch of Getir which is GetirFood on demand food delivery startup. Because it was a new Project, our team was very small. Being a small team was a great chance to witness all the business decisions in person. I was a part of the team being in the process of being a second-top food delivery business in Turkey. I had learnt not only the business environment but also practical coding and developing infrastructures for the business team.

Completing my two month full-time internship, I have continued as a part-time job with my studies for an extra 5 months. In these 5 months, I have dealt with the Business Intelligence infrastructure of the start-up using visualization tool Tableau. This system is still in usage at the company and this was a very valuable experience to develop useful reporting dashboards for the team.

My second internship was at Huawei R&D center dealing with the new search engine Project of Huawei Petal Search. During this two-month internship, I was in the Ranking Algorithm team which is the algorithm of ranking the related documents in a search engine. I took a course about Text Retrieval and Search Engines during the internship to be familiar with the concept of Search Engine. As the Ranking Team, we have analyzed the existing Ranking code with the CatBoost model. I did parameter tuning of the model to improve the success of the model. 

In my senior year, I started to work at Getir as a Data Scientist. I have been working for more than 2 years in that company. I am part of the Recommendation Team that deals with Personalization related algorithms in the Food Delivery app GetirFood. We have deployed our Recommendation Model in production and served more than 4 million clients. And now specifically, I am doing research for Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems. My interests specialized in Natural Language Processing and Recommendation Engines in my job.
