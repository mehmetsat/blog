I am a Data Scientist who has a strong technical background as an Electrical Engineer. I have decided to continue my career in Data Science and working in that field over 2 years which is related to my interest areas Natural Language Processing and Recommendation Engines. My objective is to learn every step of developing a Machine Learning Model from how data has stored and managed to which model is used and monitoring its success in the real life.
